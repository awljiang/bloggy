### Background
Global warming is expected to result in a rise of the average global temperature between 1.1 to 6.4 degree celsius over the century, if there are no interventions taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are contributed by multiple drivers which include economic activities such as electricity production, transportation and waste generation. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities.

In December 2020, the European Union (EU) leaders committed to an ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 55% by 2030 to tackle climate change. The EU is currently the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Measures, such as emission taxes and use of renewable energy sources, were introduced to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide emissions.

### Motivation
A large amount of climate change related statistics are available on Eurostat, with data across multiple domains such as environmental, social and economic statistics. Monitoring of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be performed and is essential for tracking EU's progress towards achieving its 2030 goal. Analysis of the impacts of the drivers and mitigation using the available statistics also allowed for insights on the determinants of the greenhouse gas emissions for the EU countries.

### Project Objectives
The project aims to deliver an R-Shiny app that provides interactive user interface design to:

* Understand the correlation of factors affecting greenhouse gas emissions
* Identify important factors which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions using Panel data regression
* Further analyse the difference in greenhouse gas emissions by country and time period

### Broad Data Description
Statistics from Eurostat covering a wide range of domains are used in this R Shiny Application. For our project, we will focus on datasets under greenhouse gas emissions (specifically carbon dioxide emissions), drivers and mitigation for all EU countries. 

### Proposed Scope and Methodology
1. Analysis of Eurostat greenhouse emission dataset with background research
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods in R
3. Analysis of Panel data regression (using plm package) in R
4. Development of validating checks and model selection in R
5. R-Shiny app development for user interactivity

A generalized development timeframe for this project is shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
library(knitr)
library(png)
timeline_path <- "./image/timeline.png"
include_graphics(timeline_path)
```

### Storyboard & Visualization Features

### (A) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods in R

The proposed layout of the R Shiny app consists of 3 main tabs in the tab panel

Under the EDA tab, there will be another tab panel comprising of 4 tabs shown below:

Data|Proposed Visualisation
:-:|:---:
Greenhouse Gases Emission|![](./image/EDA1.jpg){width=100%}
Green Energy Production|![](./image/EDA2.jpg){width=100%}
Correlation Plot of Drivers and Mitigation|![](./image/EDA3.jpg){width=100%}
Scatter Plot for Drivers and Mitigation|![](./image/EDA4.jpg){width=100%}

### (B) Analysis of Panel data regression (using plm package) in R

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
library(knitr)
library(png)
model1_path <- "./image/Modeling1.png"
include_graphics(model1_path)
```

If user(s) prefers to see in terms of bar chart i.e. "Bar" is selected under the View option.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
library(knitr)
library(png)
model2_path <- "./image/Modeling2.png"
include_graphics(model2_path)
```

### (C) Development of validating checks and model selection in R 

To cater to varying statistical knowledge of users, there will be two types of outputs shown - (1) simplified overview of whether the assumptions for the calibrated model is met and (2) detailed outputs from each validation tests.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/Validation.png")
```

The list of validation tests for the panel models include:

 - Test of **poolability** using Chow test
 - Tests for **individual and time effects** using Lagrange multiplier test
 - Test for **correlation between unobserved effects and the regressors** using Hausman-type test
 - Test for **stationarity of the series** using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
 - Test for **cross-sectional dependence** using the Pesaran CD test of independence
