Three tabs are included as part of this tab - Summary, Plot and Detailed Output. These tabs will display the outputs of the OLS model in different forms. User can toggle between the tabs to view their preferred way for interpreting the results of the variable selection.

Guide has been included in each tab on how to interpret the output/ plot. 


### 4.2 Model Selected

This tab allows users to analyse the outputs of the selected model, along with validating any violation of assumptions. For the selection options on the left panel, the first 3 selections (Dependent Variable, Independent Variable and Year of Analysis) apply to all the tabs within the tab while the remaining selections allows users to select the preferred test option for each assumption.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ols_sm.png")
```

Six tabs are included as part of this tab - Output (Table), Output (Plot), Heteroskedasticity Test, Residual Diagnostics, Collinear Diagnostics and Model Fit Assessment. 

The first two tabs in this tab (Output in Table and Plot) will display the outputs of the selected OLS model in tabular and visualised forms. User can toggle between these tabs to view their preferred way for interpreting the results of the OLS model.

The Heteroskedasticity Test, Residual Diagnostics and Collinear Diagnostics tab display the respective outputs for each assumption test, while the Model Fit Assessment tab allows users to visually assess the fit of the OLS model. 

Guide has been included in each tab on how to interpret the output/ plot. 


## 5.0 Panel Data Regression

Under the Panel Data Regression tab of the main navigation bar, there are two drop-downs namely "Model Building" and "Tests for Assumptions". More details on each drop-down tab are detailed in the next few sections. 

### 5.1 Model Building

This tab allows users to construct the panel data regression model of interest. The selection options on the left panel apply to all the tabs within the tab.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/panel_mb.png")
```

(1) Select the range of Years to be included.

(2) Select the countries of interest by clicking on each country to check or uncheck the selection. Click on the Select All button to select all the countries and the Deselect All button to clear all selection. For panel model, more than 1 country should be selected.

(3) Select the dependent variable among the 4 greenhouse gas types. Only 1 selection is allowed.

(4) Select the independent variables of interest. Multiple variables can be selected. To remove a variable from the selected list, use backspace on keyboard to delete it.

(5) Select the model type between "Fixed Effect" and "Random Effect" to run.

(6) Select the effects of "Individual", "Time" or "Two-ways" to use for the model.

(7) This option will only appear if "Random Effect" is selected for Model Type. Select the computation method among the 4 methods for the random model.

(8) This option will only appear if "Random Effect" is selected for Model Type, and is meant for the Model Fit Assessment. Select the type for the Lagrange Multiplier Test among the 3 types.

(9) Click "Apply changes" to generate the output of the constructed panel model.

Four tabs are included as part of this tab - Summary, Plot, Detailed Output and Model Fit Assessment. 

The first three tabs in this tab (Summary, Plot and Detailed Output) will display the outputs of the constructed panel model in different forms. User can toggle between the tabs to view their preferred way for interpreting the results of the panel model.

The Model Fit Assessment tab performs the relevant statistical tests to determine the most appropriate model type. When "Fixed Effect" is selected for Model Type, Hausman Test and Chow Test of Poolability will be performed to assess fixed effect against random and pooled effect respectively. When "Random Effect" is selected for Model Type, Hausman Test and Lagrange Multiplier Test will be performed to assess random effect against fixed and pooled effect respectively. 

Guide has been included in each tab on how to interpret the output/ plot. 


### 5.2 Tests for Assumptions

This tab allows users to assess if the data complies with the assumptions of panel data regression. The selection options on the left panel allows users to select the preferred test option for each assumption.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/panel_assump.png")
```

(1) Select the preferred plot for assessing any violation of normality assumption. Users can choose between "Residual QQ-plot", "Residual vs Fitted Value Plot" or "Residual Histogram".

(3) Select between statistical test or plot for assessing reference of heteroscedasticity. Users can choose between "Breusch-Pagan Test" or "Residual vs Fitted Value Plot",

(4) Click "Apply changes" to generate the output of each selected test.

The respective output for each assumption test will be shown in the respective tab on the right. Guide has been included in each tab on how to interpret the output/ plot.
